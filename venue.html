                                    <h4>Hyundai Venue Variants & Prices:</h4>
                                    
                                    <p> It is sold in six variants: E, S, S+, SX, SX+, and SX (O). The sub-4 metre SUV is priced from Rs 6.7 lakh to Rs 11.4 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).</p><br>
                                    <h4>Hyundai Venue Engines:</h4>

                                    <p> Hyundai offers its sub-4m SUV with a choice of three BS6 engine options: two petrol and one diesel. The 1.2-litre petrol engine is mated to a 5-speed manual and has an output of 83PS/114Nm. It is offered only on the E, S and S+ variants of the Venue. The sub-4 metre SUV now gets the Kia Seltos’ 1.5-litre diesel engine that produces 100PS/240Nm. However, it is not offered with an automatic option. Hyundai has also given the Venue a brand-new 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder turbocharged petrol motor with an output of 120PS/171Nm. This unit is available with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and is offered from the S variant onwards. The turbo-petrol engine also gets a 6-speed iMT that has a manual shifter but deletes the clutch pedal and is more affordable than a conventional automatic option.</p><br>
